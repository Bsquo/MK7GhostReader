# MK7GhostReader
Original script by [willsigg](https://github.com/willsigg/MK7GhostReader).

This script will read and print out info about Mario Kart 7 ghosts. You can also feel free to use/edit/include it to your own liking, as it includes a class for all the metadata.

A description of the ghost file format can be found [here](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/User:B_squo#DAT_.28File_Format.29_.28Mario_Kart_7.27s_Ghost_Format.29).

## Prerequisites
1. Install the **bitstring** module:
```
pip install bitstring
```
If you have errors executing the `pip` command, you may not have it installed in your computer. In that case, [install the command](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/) and try the command above again.

## Usage
```
python mk7ghosts.py your_ghost.py
```
